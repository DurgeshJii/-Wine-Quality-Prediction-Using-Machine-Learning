# -Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine using machine learning techniques based on its physicochemical properties. The goal is to classify wine as Good Quality or Bad Quality using a supervised learning approach.

🚀 Project Overview

Dataset: Red Wine Quality Dataset (winequality.csv)

Total Records: 1,599

Features: 11 numerical attributes

Target Variable: quality (binarized as Good ≥ 7, Bad < 7)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

NumPy, Pandas – Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning model

📊 Workflow

Data loading and inspection
